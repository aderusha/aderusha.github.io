# HASP v0.40 release

New fonts, new pages, new automations, new models, and some core code improvements

## Nextion HMI

This release marks the first major update the Nextion HMI used by the HASP project.

* Proportional fonts - Noto Sans has been added in 6 different sizes and styles
* Anti-aliased fonts - The existing Consolas and Wingdings fonts, as well as the new Noto Sans font are now all anti-aliased.
* FontAwesome icons - All [free FontAwesome icon codepoints](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet) have been added to the Noto Sans fonts in the project, allowing mixed used of text and icons anywhere text is allowed.
* Removed page 9 with graph component - A poll of users suggested this wasn't being used and we gained a lot of RAM by removing it.
* Added new page 9 with HVAC control demonstration
* Added new page 10 with Ceiling Fan control demonstration
* Added new page 11 with one large, blank button for future use
* Removed QR code from page 0 - again, a memory saving feature.  WiFi setup QR is now a static picture object.
* Upgraded to Nextion firmware 1.60 - latest release as of this writing

* Full compatibility with Lovelace UI
* Color "theme" support with pull-down list of included themes
* Interactive color select UI
* Font select UI for page select buttons
