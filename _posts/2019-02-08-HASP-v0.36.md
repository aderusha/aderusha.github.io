*Well this is embarrassing....*

# HASP 0.36 release

No new features whatsoever.

## ESP8266 code v0.36

* Not a single new thing added to the code, apart from changing 0.35 to 0.36
* Ran into [this problem](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/issues/809) which stems from being compiled by 2.5.0b3. This is no good, so we're going back to a stable release.

## Home Assistant Automations

* Nothing

## 3D printable models

* Nada

## PCB

* Zilch

## ESP8266 Update Procedure

If you're using the [AutoFirmwareUpdate](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Home_Assistant/hasp-examples/plate01/hasp_plate01_00_autofirmwareupdate.yaml) automation your devices should pull this update at 3:00am. Otherwise, log into the admin web page and you can pull the update from the firmware page.

## Home Assistant Update Procedure

Run the `deployhasp.sh` script to pull down the updated automations using one of the guides below:

* [`deployhasp.sh` for standard installations](https://github.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/blob/master/Documentation/05_Home_Assistant.md#automatic-home-assistant-installation)
