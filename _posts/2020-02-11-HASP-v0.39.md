Home Assistant Lovelace compatibility release

# HASP v0.39 release

Home Assistant Lovelace compatibility release

## Home Assistant Automations

* Remove "views" as they will be deprecated in 107
* Fixed automations utilizing `time_pattern` to match documentation
* Changed weather provider to NWS as Met.no is no longer allowed to be configured manually
* Another MDI icon rename fix
* Update deployhasp.sh with some fixes for newer Home Assistant installations
* Added "migrate-hasp-107.sh" to automatically remove the "view" statements for compatibility w/ version 107
* Added example Lovelace YAML to replace some of the functionality lost from "view"

## Fix for Home Assistant v107

Home Assistant is finally removing the "States" UI which has some unique functionality not present in Lovelace.  In order to keep your configuration compatible with the new release, you can execute `migrate-hasp-107.sh` from your Home Installation directory to clear out the offending statements in your existing installation.

```bash
sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
cd ~/.homeassistant
bash <(wget -qO- -o /dev/null https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aderusha/HASwitchPlate/master/Home_Assistant/migrate-hasp-107.sh)
```
